        <h1>About the Blue-Breasted Kingfisher</h1>

        Appearance (h2)
        The blue-breasted kingfisher (Halcyon malimbica) is a fairly large kingfisher (25cm high) with a distinctive blue breast from which it takes its name. You can also recognise it by its huge red and black bill. The sexes are fairly similar in appearance.
        
        <h2>Call</h2>
        
        Its call is a loud and far-carrying, undulating laughing trill: begins with a sharp ti or chiu succeeded by a series of mournful whistles chiu pu-pu-pu-pu ku ku ku ku. There is a raucous flight alarm call tchup tchup-tchup-tchup.
        
        <h2>Where & When</h2>
        
        It can be seen at any time of year in The Gambia, near water and especially in the mangroves of the River Gambiaâ€™s tributaries, usually hiding in the shade. The mangroves around Mandina Lodge, as well as Kotu creek would be a good bet.
        
        <h2>Behaviour</h2>

        It is omnivorous, mainly eating insects as well as arthropods, fish, frogs and palm oil kernels. Pairs breed in the late rainy season, nesting in termite mounds.
